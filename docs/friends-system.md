# Friends System Implementation

### Backend API Endpoints

#### Friends Management (`/api/friends/`)

1. **POST /api/friends/request**
   - Send a friend request to another user
   - Validates user exists and prevents self-requests
   - Auto-accepts if bidirectional request exists

2. **GET /api/friends/requests**
   - Get all pending incoming friend requests
   - Returns user info (nickname, avatar) with request details

3. **POST /api/friends/accept/{id}**
   - Accept a pending friend request
   - Verifies request is addressed to current user

4. **POST /api/friends/decline/{id}**
   - Decline a pending friend request
   - Changes status to 'declined'

5. **DELETE /api/friends/remove/{id}**
   - Remove a friend (delete friendship)
   - Works bidirectionally

6. **GET /api/friends/list**
   - Get all friends with online status
   - Sorted by online status, then alphabetically
   - Includes `is_online` and `last_seen` fields

7. **GET /api/friends/search?q={query}**
   - Search users by nickname (case-insensitive)
   - Min 2 characters
   - Excludes self
   - Shows friendship status for each result
